# Getting started

Ask the assistant to help you come up with a simple app idea, or tell it your idea and ask for step‑by‑step help to get started.
- Try: 'Give me 3 simple app ideas I can finish in 4 weeks' *or* 'I want to build [APP IDEA]. Help me get started step-by-step'

# How to work with the helper (Copilot / assistant)

- Turn off Copilot: Next Edit Suggestions
- Ask short, clear questions. Examples that work well:
  - "Give me 3 simple app ideas I can finish in 4 weeks."
  - "Show an HTML form and a short script that saves a note and shows it on the page." 
  - "This piece of code doesn't work: [paste your snippet]. Tell me the likely problem and how to fix it."
  - "Explain [something you don't understand]"
  - "How should I structure the data for [my app]?"
- The assistant will NOT give you a full finished project to submit. It will help with tiny, teachable steps and short examples so you learn.
